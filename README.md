# Web-Plate
A web application designed for restaurants and businesses alike, with database management for customising and building menu items, creating orders, and viewing sales. 
- Express.js backend
- PostgreSQL database
- Passport.js middleware for secure user authentication and session management
- Express-Validator middleware for sanitising and validating form data
- EJS for dynamically rendering HTML views
Deployed with Render [here](https://web-plate.onrender.com).
 NOTE: Render is very slow on start up and can take up to a minute to load when first opened. Also, Render databases are deleted every 90 days, so website may be down if I don't restart it in time.
